CSCI 330: The Good Parts
========================

-----------------------------------------
An unofficial database systems curriculum
-----------------------------------------

Databases are used *everywhere*. Their ubiquity and significance are convincing
enough to most computer science students that they realize that database skills
will help them get ahead. However, official database curricula occasionally
miss the mark as far as inspiring confidence, providing context, and ensuring
competence go.

The name of this project is a nod to `JavaScript: The Good Parts
<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do>`_, which is an excellent
(and short) book. People who aren't terribly fond of JS tend to conclude that
the book's brevity is because there aren't enough good parts in the language to
make the book bigger. Another possible reason is that the book focuses on being
concise and conveying the relevant information needed to write good code in JS.

The instructional text in this project is likely to be brief for both of those
reasons as well. Our scope will exclude many of the more regrettable portions
of the canonical course while including more material that fits a 21st century
perspective. Our goal is to provide our peers with direly-needed guidance and
perspectives on modern databases in a readable, understandable manner.

This project is developed `on GitHub
